# Scripts - What is this thing?
This scripts folder contains scripts I've used for some system administration tasks.

It is broken out into folders as clearly as can be for easy reference.

## Powershell
Powershell scripts I've come up with to help make administering Office365 a little bit easier.
- I've also added as a backup some of my manual display resolution changers

## JAMF-OSX
Bash scripts I'm using to manage OS X systems. They can be run locally on machines but I've been deploying and running them with Casper - they may still work in JAMF Pro.
